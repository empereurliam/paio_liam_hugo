# HackaGames v0.1.0 - An Hackable Games' Engine

![](resources/logo-128.png)

**HackaGames** aims to be a *C* game engine dedicated for the development of Artificial Intelligence (AIs) in any languages.
The project is based on a multimedia library *RayLib* for rendering and is developed accordingly to [KISS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principe_KISS)  (Keep It Stupid Simple) principle.
The main feature of this project is to model the world as a tabletop seen as a collection of cells connected together on with 
interacting entities (Pieces) can be moved.
Players and AIs would be responsible for Piecesâ€™ behaviors and can be implemented in independent programs in any language of your choice.
In other terms, **HackaGames** implement a simple client/server architecture to permit AI to take a seat on a game through a simple network protocol.

**HackaGames** is seen as an API for game development.
Several games are proposed with the API for example

- **421**: A very simple one player dice game to get the concept of AI implementation (not a core HackaGames client/server game).
- **RISKY**: A turn-based strategic game where players control armies fighting for a territory.

## Concurency:

**HackaGame** is not what you looking for ? Try those solutions:

- https://ludii.games/ "a general game system designed to play, evaluate and design a wide range of games" (JAVA)
- https://www.pommerman.com/ an hackable Bomberman game (Python)
- https://www.codingame.com web-based environment for *NPC* development (complete solution but not open).

## License

**HackaGame** is distributed under the [MIT license](./LICENCE.md).

## Installation (Linux)

**HackaGames** is natively developed on and for Linux systems.
Commands are given regarding Ubuntu-like distribution.

The classical way to get **HackaGames** is to clone then buid the project.
So first, you can clone this repository (game engine plus games):

```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/imt-mobisyst/hackagames.git
cd hackagames
```

### Dependencies:

**HackaGame** requires C/C++ development tools, CMake and [RayLib dependencies](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
  build-essential git cmake \
  libasound2-dev mesa-common-dev \
  libx11-dev libxi-dev xorg-dev \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
```

Then get and build RayLib (version `3.0.0`):

```bash
./bin/get-raylib.sh
```

<!--
And finally mosquitto:

```bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mosquitto-dev/mosquitto-ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-dev
```
-->


### **HackaGame**

A simple build scripts would generate the overall project:

```bash
./bin/build
```

It will enter each HackaGames submodules including games and build them with cmake, starting by hackagames libraries and tools.

To build only the librairies and tools, enter `hackagames` directopy and build it with cmake.

```sh
cd hackagames
cmake ..
make
```

## Getting started

The easiest way is to enter in one of the example games as [risky](./game-risky) .

Start a game `./play-risky.py` and read the `game-risky/README.md`.
